## What I learned
- useful VSC shortcuts for copying lines down, inserting lines, selecting and changing multiple of the same words,...
- how to quickly and easily create multiple divs in an html document using VSC
- use a couple of accent colors with a couple of neutral colors for designing nice-looking websites
- combine CSS grid and flexbox to easily create layouts
- define variables with double dashes in :root and reuse them throughout CSS using var();
- creating and using utility classes
- write and organize CSS with care, as a newly/later inserted class may overwrite the properties of a previous one if an element has both
- take care in writing HTML, as it has to be semantically correct; its purpose is labeling, not designing content
- outline: 0; and outline: none; should not be used because it makes websites inaccessible to visually impared users (use https://wave.webaim.org/ to test websites); SOLUTION: provide alternative styling to focused links (background color, text color, outline)
